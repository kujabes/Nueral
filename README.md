# Nueral Network from Scratch

### The Goal of this project is to explore the inner working of machine learning by implementing a neural network from scratch using only numpy
- Using Numpy, we will implement forward pass through an arbitrary network object
- Attempt to train the network using a loss function and back propagation
- Try different combinations of activation functions for each layer to see impact on training efficiency
